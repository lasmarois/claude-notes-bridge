# Roadmap Rules

## Reading the Roadmap

The roadmap at `@planning/ROADMAP.md` is the big-picture guide for this project.

### Confidence Levels
- `[committed]` — We're doing this, approach is clear
- `[likely]` — High confidence, but details may evolve
- `[exploratory]` — Direction is set, implementation TBD

### Horizons
- **Horizon 1 (Near):** Current focus, detailed plans
- **Horizon 2 (Mid):** Next up, sketched out
- **Horizon 3 (Far):** Vision, subject to change

## Updating the Roadmap

### When to Update
- After completing a milestone
- When discoveries change our understanding
- When pivoting based on new information
- When moving items between confidence levels

### How to Update
1. Check off completed items
2. Add new discoveries to "Open Questions"
3. Promote/demote confidence levels as clarity emerges
4. Add entry to "Version History" for significant changes
5. Keep "Out of Scope" current

### Pivot Points
When hitting a pivot point:
1. Document what we learned
2. Update roadmap with new direction
3. Note the pivot in Version History

## Relationship to Goals

- **Roadmap:** Big picture, milestones, direction
- **Goals (GOALS.md):** Concrete work units with planning files
- **Milestones spawn Goals:** Each milestone may become 1+ goals

Example:
```
Roadmap M1 (Read-Only MVP)
  → goal-3: Swift project scaffolding
  → goal-4: SQLite + protobuf decoding
  → goal-5: MCP server integration
```

## Golden Rule

The roadmap guides but doesn't constrain. If we discover a better path, update the roadmap — don't force-fit work into outdated plans.
