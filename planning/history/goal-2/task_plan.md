# Task Plan: Define Flexible Roadmap

## Goal
Create a big-picture roadmap that is flexible, evolvable, and integrated into project memory via .claude/CLAUDE.md imports and .claude/rules.

## Current Phase
Phase 1

## Phases

### Phase 1: Design Roadmap Structure
- [x] Define roadmap format (milestones, phases, flexibility mechanisms)
- [x] Decide location (planning/ROADMAP.md)
- [x] Design for discoverability and adaptability
- **Status:** complete

### Phase 2: Create Roadmap Document
- [x] Write initial roadmap based on goal-1 findings
- [x] Include milestones with flexibility markers
- [x] Add "open questions" and "pivot points" sections
- **Status:** complete

### Phase 3: Integrate into Memory
- [x] Update .claude/CLAUDE.md to import roadmap
- [x] Create .claude/rules/roadmap.md with usage instructions
- **Status:** complete

### Phase 4: Archive Goal
- [ ] Move files to planning/history/goal-2/
- [ ] Update GOALS.md
- [ ] Commit
- **Status:** in_progress

## Key Questions
1. What format keeps roadmap flexible but actionable?
2. How granular should milestones be?
3. How to mark "tentative" vs "committed" items?

## Decisions Made
| Decision | Rationale |
|----------|-----------|

## Notes
- Roadmap should guide but not constrain
- Each milestone can spawn multiple goals
- Include "what we don't know yet" explicitly
